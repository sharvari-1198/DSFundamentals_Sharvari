The earbuds are okay, but not exceptional.Decent sound, but I expected more for the price.They work fine, but the fit isn’t great for my ears.The battery life is average, nothing special.Sound quality is fine, but not the best I’ve heard.They do the job, but they’re not super impressive.The noise cancellation is decent, but could be better.The earbuds are fine, but the case feels a bit cheap.
